 - project .ewd/.eww/.ewp: A pre-configured project file with the provided library 
                           structure that produces an executable image with IAR 
                           Embedded Workbench.
                
 - stm32f4xx_flash.icf : This file is the IAR Linker configuration file used to 
                         place program code (readonly) in internal FLASH and data
                         (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in internal SRAM. 
                         You can customize this file to your need.

 @par How to use it ?

 - Open the Project.eww workspace.
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Download and Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)

 @note The needed define symbols for this config are already declared in the
       preprocessor section: USE_STM324xG_EVAL, STM32F4XX, USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER
