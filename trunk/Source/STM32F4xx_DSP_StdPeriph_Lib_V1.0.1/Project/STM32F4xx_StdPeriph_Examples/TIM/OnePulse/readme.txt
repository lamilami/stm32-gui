@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to generate a One pulse Mode 
after a Rising edge of an external signal is received in Timer Input pin.

TIM2CLK = SystemCoreClock/2, we want to get TIM2 counter clock at 42 MHz:
  - Prescaler = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 168 MHz.

The Autoreload value is 65535 (TIM4->ARR), so the maximum frequency value to 
trigger the TIM4 input is 42000000/65535 = 641 Hz.

The TIM4 is configured as follows: 
The One Pulse mode is used, the external signal is connected to TIM4 CH2 pin (PB.07), 
the rising edge is used as active edge, the One Pulse signal is output 
on TIM4_CH1 (PB.06).

The TIM_Pulse defines the delay value, the delay value is fixed to:
delay =  CCR1/TIM4 counter clock = 16383 / 42000000 = 390 us. 
The (TIM_Period - TIM_Pulse) defines the One Pulse value, the pulse value is fixed to:
One Pulse value = (TIM_Period - TIM_Pulse)/TIM4 counter clock 
                = (65535 - 16383) / 42000000 = 1.170 ms.

      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3988 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
  
@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM324xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up 
   - Connect the external signal to the TIM4_CH2 pin (PB.07)
   - Connect the TIM4_CH1 (PB.06) pin to an oscilloscope to monitor the waveform.   
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
