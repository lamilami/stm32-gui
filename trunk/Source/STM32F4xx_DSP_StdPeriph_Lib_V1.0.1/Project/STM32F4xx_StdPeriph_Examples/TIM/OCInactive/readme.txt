@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in Output Compare Inactive 
mode with the corresponding Interrupt requests for each channel.

The TIM2CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), and the objective is
to get TIM2 counter clock at 2 KHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1
SystemCoreClock is set to 168 MHz for STM32F4xx devices

The TIM2 CCR1 register value is equal to 1000:
TIM2_CC1 delay = CCR1_Val/TIM2 counter clock  = 500 ms
so the PA.00  is reset after a delay equal to 500 ms.

The TIM2 CCR2 register value is equal to 500:
TIM2_CC2 delay = CCR2_Val/TIM2 counter clock = 250 ms
so the PA.01  is reset after a delay equal to 250 ms.

The TIM2 CCR3 register value is equal to 250:
TIM2_CC3 delay = CCR3_Val/TIM2 counter clock = 125 ms
so the PA.02  is reset after a delay equal to 125 ms.

The TIM2 CCR4 register value is equal to 125:
TIM2_CC4 delay = CCR4_Val/TIM2 counter clock = 62.5 ms
so the PA.03  is reset after a delay equal to 62.5 ms.

While the counter is lower than the Output compare registers values, which 
determines the Output delay, the PG.06, PG.08, PI.09 and PC.07 pin are turned on. 

When the counter value reaches the Output compare registers values, the Output 
Compare interrupts are generated and, in the handler routine, these pins are turned off.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM324xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins and connect them an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms.
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
