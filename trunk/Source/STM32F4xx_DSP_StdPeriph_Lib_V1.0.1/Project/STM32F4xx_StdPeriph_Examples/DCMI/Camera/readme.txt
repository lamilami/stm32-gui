@par Description

This example shows how to use the DCMI to control the OV9655 or OV2640 Camera module
mounted on STM324xG-EVAL board RevB. 

Both cameras have an image array capable of operating at up to 15 frames per second 
in SXGA resolution with complete user control over image quality, formatting and
output data transfer. All required image processing functions are also programmable
through the SCCB interface (I2C like protocol).

In this example the DCMI is configured to interface with this 8 bit data camera
in continuous mode. The I2C1 is used to configure the Camera in 8 bit RGB 5:6:5 mode. 
The user can select between two resolutions QQVGA(160x120) or QVGA(320x240) in order 
to display the captured image on the LCD(320x240), this selection is performed 
at application run time using the Joystick UP, DOWN and SEL buttons.
All camera data received by the DCMI are transferred through the DMA and displayed
on the LCD (connected to FSMC). As a result the CPU is free to execute other tasks.

You can use the potentiometer RV1 to fine tune on the fly the camera's brightness.

@par How to use it ?
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following files the project source list
     - camera_api.c
     - dcmi_ov2640.c
     - dcmi_ov9655.c
     - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\Common\lcd_log.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
