@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the RNG peripheral to
generate Random 32bit numbers.

For this example, an interactive human interface is developed to allow user to
display 8 (arbitrary value, which can be updated by user) random 32bit numbers
using the eval board LCD and/or USART (CN16) with PC HyperTerminal, using 
PRINT_ON_LCD and PRINT_ON_USART defines in main.c

After startup, user is asked to press key button.
The 8 Random 32bit numbers are displayed as soon as the key is pressed.

The USARTx is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled


@par Directory contents 

  - RNG/RNG_MultiRNG/system_stm32f4xx.c   STM32F4xx system clock configuration file
  - RNG/RNG_MultiRNG/stm32f4xx_conf.h     Library Configuration file
  - RNG/RNG_MultiRNG/stm32f4xx_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file
  - RNG/RNG_MultiRNG/stm32f4xx_it.c       Interrupt handlers
  - RNG/RNG_MultiRNG/main.c               Main program

@note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3988 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
 

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM324xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port if you want to display data on the HyperTerminal.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP22 is in position 1-2
 
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
